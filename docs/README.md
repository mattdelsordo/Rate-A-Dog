Rate-A-Dog is an Android app that uses AWS Rekognition to allow users to rate photos of dogs that they upload to the service. In practice this basically means using Rekognition to determine whether the photo contains a dog and then returning a rating of "Good", because, honestly, they're all good dogs. There is an edge case where dogs are rated "Bad" but the casual user probably won't encounter it.
